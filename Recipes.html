                        <h2>Vegetable Rava Upma</h2><p>1. To begin making the Vegetable Rava Upma Recipe/ Sooji Upma, prep all the ingredients and keep aside.<br>2. In a saucepan; boil 3-1/4 cups of water along with salt and sugar and set aside. Add the vegetables to this water and cook for a few minutes until cooked. Turn the heat to low and allow the water to remain warm.<br>3. Heat oil in heavy bottomed pan on medium heat; add mustard seeds, half urad dal seeds and allow it to crackle and the dal to turn golden brown and crisp.<br>4. Stir in the onions, ginger, asafoetida, curry leaves and green chilies and saut√© until onions are tender.<br>5. Stir in the semolina/sooji/rava and roast along with the onion mixture until you get the light roasted aroma.<br>6. Gradually pour the hot water along with the vegetables into the above mixture and continue to stir in the process to prevent lump formation. Once the Rava Upma comes to a porridge like consistency, turn the heat to low, cover the pan and allow the Rava Upma to cook and steam in the heat.<br>7. Keep stirring occasionally to avoid lumps. This will take about 10 minutes.<br>8. Finally stir in the ghee and lemon juice and saut√© for a couple of minutes on low heat until all the ingredients are well combined. The ghee enhances the flavour of the Rava Upma/ Sooji Upma.<br>9.

                        <h2>Vegetable Biryani</h2><p>To prepare veg biryani, start by washing and soaking 1.5 cups of basmati rice for 30 minutes, then drain and set it aside. In a large pan, heat 3 tablespoons of ghee or oil and add a bay leaf, 3 cloves, a 1-inch cinnamon stick, and 2 cardamoms. Saut√© for a minute before adding a large, thinly sliced onion and 2 slit green chilies. Cook until the onions turn golden brown, then add 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and saut√© until the raw smell disappears. Next, add a chopped tomato and cook until it softens. Incorporate 2 cups of mixed vegetables (such as carrot, peas, beans, and potato) and cook for a few minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of yogurt, 2 tablespoons of biryani masala, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, and salt to taste, mixing well. Add the drained rice and mix gently to coat the rice with the spices. Pour in 3 cups of water, then add a handful of chopped coriander and mint leaves, mixing well. Cover the pan and cook on low heat until the rice is fully cooked and the water is absorbed, which should take about 15-20 minutes. Once done, drizzle a pinch of saffron soaked in 2 tablespoons of warm milk over the biryani, cover, and let it rest for 5 minutes. Finally, fluff the biryani gently with a fork before serving.</p>
