                            <h2>Vegetable Biryani</h2><p>To prepare veg biryani, start by washing and soaking 1.5 cups of basmati rice for 30 minutes, then drain and set it aside. In a large pan, heat 3 tablespoons of ghee or oil and add a bay leaf, 3 cloves, a 1-inch cinnamon stick, and 2 cardamoms. Saut√© for a minute before adding a large, thinly sliced onion and 2 slit green chilies. Cook until the onions turn golden brown, then add 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and saut√© until the raw smell disappears. Next, add a chopped tomato and cook until it softens. Incorporate 2 cups of mixed vegetables (such as carrot, peas, beans, and potato) and cook for a few minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of yogurt, 2 tablespoons of biryani masala, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, and salt to taste, mixing well. Add the drained rice and mix gently to coat the rice with the spices. Pour in 3 cups of water, then add a handful of chopped coriander and mint leaves, mixing well. Cover the pan and cook on low heat until the rice is fully cooked and the water is absorbed, which should take about 15-20 minutes. Once done, drizzle a pinch of saffron soaked in 2 tablespoons of warm milk over the biryani, cover, and let it rest for 5 minutes. Finally, fluff the biryani gently with a fork before serving.</p>

                            <h2>Egg Biryani</h2><p>For egg biryani, wash and soak 1.5 cups of basmati rice for 30 minutes, then drain and set it aside. Hard boil 6 eggs, peel, and set aside. Heat 3 tablespoons of ghee or oil in a large pan and add a bay leaf, 3 cloves, a 1-inch cinnamon stick, and 2 cardamoms, saut√©ing for a minute. Add a large, thinly sliced onion and 2 slit green chilies, cooking until the onions turn golden brown. Add a tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and saut√© until the raw smell disappears. Add a chopped tomato and cook until it softens. Stir in 1/2 cup of yogurt, 2 tablespoons of biryani masala, a teaspoon of red chili powder, a teaspoon of turmeric powder, and salt to taste. Add the boiled eggs, making small slits in them to allow the spices to penetrate. Add the drained rice and mix gently to coat the rice with the spices. Pour in 3 cups of water and mix well. Cover the pan and cook on low heat until the rice is fully cooked and the water is absorbed, about 15-20 minutes. Fluff the egg biryani gently with a fork before serving.</p>
